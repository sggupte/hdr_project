hdr Matlab implementation with fluorescence imaging

Code based on https://www.researchgate.net/publication/327545585_Deep_dive_into_high_dynamic_range_imaging_a_Matlab_tutorial
Adapted for green channel fluorescence imaging

There are two scripts that should be run depending on the sample:
Use the saveSegmented.m script to segment the images and save them in a folder.
Then use the saveRegistered.m script to register all the images and save them in a folder.
